* Window Management
** EXWM Configuration

We use the excellent [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] module as the basis for our Emacs Desktop Environment.  The [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki][EXWM Wiki]] is a great place to find tips about how to configure everything!

*NOTE:* Make sure you've installed =nm-applet=, =pasystray= and =blueman= for the system tray apps to work!

* Desktop Environment
** Desktop File

This file is used by your "login manager" (GDM, LightDM, etc) to display EXWM as a desktop environment option when you log in.

*IMPORTANT*: Make sure you create a symbolic link for this file into =/usr/share/xsessions=:

#+begin_src sh :tangle no

sudo ln -f ~/.emacs.d/exwm/EXWM.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/EXWM.desktop

#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :tangle ./exwm/EXWM.desktop :mkdirp yes

  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=EXWM
  Comment=Emacs Window Manager
  Exec=sh /home/bruce/.emacs.d/exwm/start-exwm.sh
  TryExec=sh
  Type=Application
  X-LightDM-DesktopName=exwm
  DesktopNames=exwm

#+end_src
** Launcher Script

This launcher script is invoked by =EXWM.desktop= to start Emacs and load our desktop environment configuration.  We also start up some other helpful applications to configure the desktop experience.

#+begin_src shell :tangle ./exwm/start-exwm.sh :shebang #!/bin/sh

  # Set the screen DPI (uncomment this if needed!)
  # xrdb ~/.emacs.d/exwm/Xresources

  # Run the screen compositor
  compton &

  # Enable screen locking on suspend
  xss-lock -- slock &

  # Fire it up
  exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session emacs -mm --debug-init -l ~/.emacs.d/desktop.el

#+end_src

** Keyboard Configuration

The =Xmodmap= file will be used with the =xmodmap= program to remap CapsLock to Ctrl inside of our desktop environment:

#+begin_src sh :tangle ./exwm/Xmodmap

  clear lock
  clear control
  keycode 66 = Control_L
  add control = Control_L
  add Lock = Control_R

#+end_src

** DPI Configuration

The =Xresources= file will be used with =xrdb= in =start-exwm.sh= to set our screen DPI:

#+begin_src conf :tangle ./exwm/Xresources

  Xft.dpi:   100   # Set this to your desired DPI!  Larger number means bigger text and UI

#+end_src
